#basic-angular

A basic Angular 2 app setup (taken from https://angularjs.org/).

```npm start``` starts a lite-server and opens it up in the broswer on localhost:3000. It also compiles the typescript files into javascript.

```npm run lite``` runs the lite-server on localhost:3000.

Other scripts are something to do with compiling the typescript.
